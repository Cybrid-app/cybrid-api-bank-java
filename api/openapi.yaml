  description: "# Cybrid API documentation\n\nWelcome to Cybrid, an all-in-one crypto\
    \ platform that enables you to easily **build** and **launch** white-label crypto\
    \ products or services.\n\nIn these documents, you'll find details on how our\
    \ REST API operates and generally how our platform functions.\n\nIf you're looking\
    \ for our UI SDK Widgets for Web or Mobile (iOS/Android), generated API clients,\
    \ or demo applications, head over to our [Github repo](https://github.com/Cybrid-app).\n\
    \n\U0001f4a1 We recommend bookmarking the [Cybrid LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/cybridtechnologies)\
    \ which contains many helpful links to platform resources.\n\n## Getting Started\n\
    \nThis is Cybrid's public interactive API documentation, which allows you to fully\
    \ test our APIs. If you'd like to use a different tool to exercise our APIs, you\
    \ can download the [Open API 3.0 yaml](https://bank.production.cybrid.app/api/schema/v1/swagger.yaml)\
    \ for import.\n\nIf you're new to our APIs and the Cybrid Platform, follow the\
    \ below guides to get set up and familiar with the platform:\n\n1. [Introduction](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/introduction)\n\
    2. [Platform Introduction](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/how-is-cybrid-architected)\n\
    3. [Testing with Hosted Web Demo App](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/testing-with-hosted-web-demo-app)\n\
    \nIn [Getting Started in the Cybrid Sandbox](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/how-do-i-get-started-with-the-sandbox),\
    \ we walk you through how to use the [Cybrid Sandbox](https://id.sandbox.cybrid.app/)\
    \ to create a test bank and generate API keys. In [Getting Ready for Trading](https://kb.cybrid.xyz/getting-ready-for-trading),\
    \ we walk through creating customers, customer identities, accounts, as well as\
    \ executing quotes and trades.\n\n## Working with the Cybrid Platform\n\nThere\
    \ are three primary ways you can interact with the Cybrid platform:\n\n1. Directly\
    \ via our RESTful API (this documentation)\n2. Using our API clients available\
    \ in a variety of languages ([Angular](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-angular),\
    \ [Java](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-java), [Kotlin](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-kotlin),\
    \ [Python](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-python), [Ruby](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-ruby),\
    \ [Swift](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-swift) or [Typescript](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-api-bank-typescript))\n\
    3. Integrating a platform specific SDK ([Web](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-sdk-web),\
    \ [Android](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-sdk-android), [iOS](https://github.com/Cybrid-app/cybrid-sdk-ios))\n\
    \nOur complete set of APIs allows you to manage resources across three distinct\
    \ areas: your `Organization`, your `Banks` and your `Identities`. For most of\
    \ your testing and interaction you'll be using the `Bank` API, which is where\
    \ the majority of APIs reside.\n\n*The complete set of APIs can be found on the\
    \ following pages:*\n\n| API                                                 \

    \ at any time for assistance, or contact the [Product Team](mailto:product@cybrid.xyz)\
    \ for product suggestions.\n\n## Authenticating with the API\n\nThe Cybrid Platform\
    \ uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens to authenticate requests to the platform. Credentials\
    \ to create `Organization` and `Bank` tokens can be generated via the [Cybrid\
    \ Sandbox](https://id.production.cybrid.app). Access tokens can be generated for\
    \ a `Customer` as well via the [Cybrid IdP](https://id.production.cybrid.app)\
    \ as well.\n\nAn `Organization` access token applies broadly to the whole Organization\
    \ and all of its `Banks`, whereas, a `Bank` access token is specific to an individual\
    \ Bank. `Customer` tokens, similarly, are scoped to a specific customer in a bank.\n\
    \nBoth `Organization` and `Bank` tokens can be created using the OAuth Client\
    \ Credential Grant flow. Each Organization and Bank has its own unique `Client\
    \ ID` and `Secret` that allows for machine-to-machine authentication.\n\nA `Bank`\
    \ can then generate `Customer` access tokens via API using our [Identities API](https://id.production.cybrid.app/api/schema/swagger-ui).\n\
    \n<font color=\"orange\">**⚠️ Never share your Client ID or Secret publicly or\
    \ in your source code repository.**</font>\n\nYour `Client ID` and `Secret` can\
    \ be exchanged for a time-limited `Bearer Token` by interacting with the Cybrid\
    \ Identity Provider or through interacting with the **Authorize** button in this\
    \ document.\n\nThe following curl command can be used to quickly generate a `Bearer\
    \ Token` for use in testing the API or demo applications.\n\n```\n# Example request\
    \ when using Bank credentials\ncurl -X POST https://id.production.cybrid.app/oauth/token\
    \ -d '{\n    \"grant_type\": \"client_credentials\",\n    \"client_id\": \"<Your\
    \ Client ID>\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"<Your Secret>\",\n    \"scope\": \"\

    orange\">**⚠️ Note: The above curl will create a bearer token with full scope\
    \ access. Delete scopes if you'd like to restrict access.**</font>\n\n## Authentication\
    \ Scopes\n\nThe Cybrid platform supports the use of scopes to control the level\
    \ of access a token is limited to. Scopes do not grant access to resources; instead,\
    \ they provide limits, in support of the least privilege principal.\n\nThe following\
    \ scopes are available on the platform and can be requested when generating either\
    \ an Organization, Bank or Customer token. Generally speaking, the _Read_ scope\
    \ is required to read and list resources, the _Write_ scope is required to update\
    \ a resource and the _Execute_ scope is required to create a resource.\n\n| Resource\
    \              | Read scope (Token Type)                                    |\
    \ Write scope (Token Type)                      | Execute scope (Token Type) \

    \nAn `Organization` is meant to represent the organization partnering with Cybrid\
    \ to use our platform.\n\nAn `Organization` typically does not directly interact\
    \ with `customers`. Instead, an Organization has one or more `banks`, which encompass\
    \ the financial service offerings of the platform.\n\n**Banks**\n\nA `Bank` is\
    \ owned by an `Organization` and can be thought of as an environment or container\
    \ for `customers` and product offerings. Banks are created in either `Sandbox`\
    \ or `Production` mode, where `Sandbox` is the environment that you would test,\
    \ prototype and build in prior to moving to `Production`.\n\nAn `Organization`\
    \ can have multiple `banks`, in either `Sandbox` or `Production` environments.\
    \ A `Sandbox Bank` will be backed by stubbed data and process flows. For instance,\
    \ funding source transfer processes as well as trades will be simulated rather\
    \ than performed, however asset prices are representative of real-world values.\
    \ You have an unlimited amount of simulated fiat currency for testing purposes.\n\
    \n**Customers**\n\n`Customers` represent your banking users on the platform. At\
    \ present, we offer support for `Individuals` as Customers.\n\n`Customers` must\
    \ be verified (i.e., KYC'd) in our system before they can play any part on the\
    \ platform, which means they must have an associated and a passing `Identity Verification`.\
    \ See the Identity Verifications section for more details on how a customer can\
    \ be verified.\n\n`Customers` must also have an `Account` to be able to transact,\
    \ in the desired asset class. See the Accounts APIs for more details on setting\
    \ up accounts for the customer.\n"
